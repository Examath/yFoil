For v0.3 of cl.m
Aim: 
    To create a class that generates a NACA profile with both
    upper and lower surfaces
Background: 
    A NACA airfoil is a series of standardised 
    airfoil (or wing cross-sections), developed by the agency now
    known as NASA. The parameters inside a 4-digit NACA code can be used 
    to parametrically define the equation for the cross section.

    The formula for a NACA airfoil consists of two parts,
    (1) the mean chamber line (or centerline):
        if (x <= locationChamber)
            yc = maximumChamber * (2 * locationChamber * x - x ^ 2) / locationChamber ^ 2
        else
            yc = maximumChamber * ((1 - 2 * locationChamber) + 2 * locationChamber * x - x ^ 2) / (1 - locationChamber) ^ 2
    (2) the thickness:
        yt = thickness * 5 * (0.2969 * sqrt(x) - 0.1260 * x - 0.3516 * x ^ 2 + 0.2843 * x ^ 3 - 0.1015 * x ^ 4)

    Where the thickness is perpendicular to the chord. This means that some
    of the points making up the upper surface are infront of the origin.
    As a 1-d function must be generated, these points must be transfered
    from the upper to lower surfaces.

Cases:
In all cases a new yellow chamber line should be visible and elapsed
time should be printed to console

Input:
    0015
Expected Output:
    No points transfered. Surface should be symetrical.
Actual Output:
    Correct symmetrical NACA 0015 w/o point transfer
    See TestingPlots/t3a.fig

Input:
    1515
Expected Output:
    No points should be transfered (at resolution used in this test).
Actual Output:
    As expected.
    See TestingPlots/t3b.fig

Input:
    9250
Expected Output:
    Upper surface and lower surface should both be functions of x, there should
    be more points on the lower surface, the origin should be the
    left-most point.
Actual Output:
    As expected.
    See TestingPlots/t3c.fig

Input:
    none
Expected Output:  
    Default input should be 4412. 
    Upper surface and lower surface should both be functions of x, there should
    be slightly more points on the lower surface, the origin should be the
    left-most point.
Actual Output:
    As expected.
