For v0.2 of cl.m
Aim: 
    To create a class that generates a NACA profile with both
    upper and lower surfaces
Background: 
    A NACA airfoil is a series of standardised 
    airfoil (or wing cross-sections), developed by the agency now
    known as NASA. The parameters inside a 4-digit NACA code can be used 
    to parametrically define the equation for the cross section.

    As described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil
    A NACA airfoil is specified by four digits:
     - (1) maximumChamber: maximum chamber as 1/10 fraction of chord
     - (2) locationChamber: maximum chamber location as 1/10 fraction of chord
     - (3 and 4) thickness: as 1/100 fraction of chord
    For example, NACA 2412 is for an aerfoil with a
    maximum chamber of 0.2, located 0.4 down the profile,
    with a thickness of 0.12 of the chord.

    the formula for a NACA airfoil consists of two parts,
    (1) the mean chamber line (or centerline):
        if (x <= locationChamber)
            yc = maximumChamber * (2 * locationChamber * x - x ^ 2) / locationChamber ^ 2
        else
            yc = maximumChamber * ((1 - 2 * locationChamber) + 2 * locationChamber * x - x ^ 2) / (1 - locationChamber) ^ 2
    (2) the thickness:
        yt = thickness * 5 * (0.2969 * sqrt(x) - 0.1260 * x - 0.3516 * x ^ 2 + 0.2843 * x ^ 3 - 0.1015 * x ^ 4)
    These two components are summed using vector addition to generate
    the airfoil. The thickness is perpendicular to the chord.
