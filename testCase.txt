For v0.5 (Test driver)
Aim: 
    Create test drivers for both NacaProfile and YProfile classes
    and their main functions
Background: 
    A NACA airfoil is a series of standardised 
    airfoil (or wing cross-sections), developed by the agency now
    known as NASA. The parameters inside a 4-digit NACA code can be used 
    to parametrically define the equation for the cross section.

    However, the formula for a NACA airfoil is very complicated, and 
    cannot be imported easily into CAD software like inventor.

    Instead, regressio preformed on the points generated by the NacaProfile
    class will be used to compute a simple polynomial + sqrt function
    (the 'yFoil') that can be easily imported into inventor.

	Due to the reliability requirments for this program (both from the
	assignment rubric and the real-word use for this app), extensive
	unit testing must be performed.

	Whilst a simple testing script would suffice, I got distracted reading
	matlab's official guide on creating unit tests, and so created a
	class unit test as recommended on https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.unittest.testcase-class.html
	The test classes are in the subfolder Testing Drivers, called YProfileTest and NacaTest respectivley
