This program is designed to meet a unique challenge â€“ parametrically adding airfoils to inventor. The current process of using splines is tedious and not parametric, whilst most other software that can do this is propietary. 

Instead, *yFoil* uses curve fitting to generate a pair of simpler equations that closely approximate any given airfoil. _yFoil_ supports generating any NACA 4-digit-series profile, or importing points in the _Lednicer_ format. These equations can then be copied into inventor.

To use, download the [standalone desktop installer](https://github.com/Examath/yFoil/releases/download/v1.1/YFInst.exe)

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Examath/yFoil/wiki) for the user guide and how to use.
