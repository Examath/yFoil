This program is designed to meet a unique challenge â€“ adding NACA airfoils to inventor. The current process of using splines is tedious and not parametric, whilst most other software that can do this is propietary. Instead, *yFoil* uses curve fitting to generate a pair of simpler equations that closely approximate any given NACA airfoil. These equations can then be copied into inventor.

To use, may either download the [MATLAB app package](https://github.com/Examath/yFoil/releases/download/v1.0/yFoil.mlappinstall) (this requires MATLAB) or the [standalone desktop installer](https://github.com/Examath/yFoil/releases/download/v1.0/YFoilInstaller.exe).

Note to accessors, the current commit is slightly ahead of what was submitted. [See the version submitted.](https://github.com/Examath/yFoil/tree/41f3d9cbca8b8d26d36922688ebaa64dc78c8838)
